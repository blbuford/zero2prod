# Reading Notes
## 3/14/22
I read the first two chapters that covered rustlang, project setup, helpful cargo addons, testing, and continuous
integration (CI). They also setup what the project of the book will be about. 

BIG Take aways here: 
- CI BEFORE YOU DO A DAMN THING. Get it setup, get it working, reap the rewards
- USER STORIES! `as a <BLANK>, I want to <BLANK>, so that <BLANK>` Write these out before you code to understand the 
    high level features you need to implement. Try to implement the enough functionality in each story, but don't be a
    perfectionist. Iteratively improve them once you have all the stories implemented in bare bones. 

p.s. fix the ci

Read up to 3.8.4.1. We started writing endpoints and tests! I got WSL2 setup and working correctly.

Big take away: Test before you implement. Refactor often. Separate your concerns.
